  abstract = {Patch management is the process for identifying, acquiring, installing, and verifying patches for products and systems. Patches correct security and functionality problems in software and firmware. There are several challenges that complicate patch management. If organizations do not overcome these challenges, they will be unable to patch systems effectively and efficiently, leading to easily preventable compromises. This publication is designed to assist organizations in understanding the basics of enterprise patch management technologies. It explains the importance of patch management and examines the challenges inherent in performing patch management. This publication also provides an overview of enterprise patch management technologies and briefly discusses metrics for measuring the technologies’ effectiveness and for comparing the relative importance of patches.},

  abstract = {Enterprise patch management is the process of identifying, prioritizing, acquiring, installing, and verifying the installation of patches, updates, and upgrades throughout an organization. Patching is more important than ever because of the increasing reliance on technology, but there is often a divide between business/mission owners and security/technology management about the value of patching. This publication frames patching as a critical component of preventive maintenance for computing technologies – a cost of doing business, and a necessary part of what organizations need to do in order to achieve their missions. This publication also discusses common factors that affect enterprise patch management and recommends creating an enterprise strategy to simplify and operationalize patching while also improving reduction of risk. Preventive maintenance through enterprise patch management helps prevent compromises, data breaches, operational disruptions, and other adverse events.},
